svg = scalable vector graphics
jpg, png etc are raster (pixel) based
zooming in on raster image makes is pixellated/grainy

rasters good for photos bc so detailed
vectors good for logos and graphics

<svg> tag defines element

<line x1= y1= etc stroke-width="5px" stroke="blue"></line>
y-axis is negative like most pixel coordinate systems

<rect x="100" y="50" height="200" fill="red" />
rx, ry = round corners

<polygon points="x,y x,y x,y" fill= etc />

<text>
text-anchor = middle, end, etc (css)

paths
ppl use programs to draw SVGs, then export paths bc complicated 
d = "M400 100
L500 300..."
M = move L = line
uppercase = absolute location
lowercase = relative " "
h = horizontal line 


things drawn later are on top

?? styles in css vs svg element

Note: if load variable A from A.js and also load script B.js, can access A in B.js

?? TODO understand/more practice with D3 update pattern
